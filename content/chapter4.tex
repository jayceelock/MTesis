\chapter{Pose Error Estimation}

\section{Introduction}

The error of the pose estimation of the computer vision system (CVS) was determined and discussed in Chapter HEEEEE\@. Since the CVS was used as a measurement device, it is critical to know what the pose estimation error would be for any pose vector sample before the CVS can be used to determine the pose error of a drone. 

It was found that the pose estimation error, i.e.\ the difference between the true pose versus the measured pose, is highly dependent on the current pose relative to the CVS's camera. The data produced also contains a large amount of noise. As a consequence of the complex nature of the data, it is close to impossible to predict the pose estimate error that the CVS produces, in a simple manner.
